#+TITLE: Copying files from the host machine to the container using shell script.

* Introduction:-
This document explains how to copy files from the host machine to the container
without enetering the password.

* Implementation
Copying files can be done using ip address of the container and also root
password of the container.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
scp /home/karthik/Desktop/sample.txt  vlead@10.4.15.211:~/test
#+END_EXAMPLE
 
The above command copies the file sample.txt in Desktop directory to test
directory of the container with ipaddress(10.4.15.211).But It asks for the password
of vlead@10.4.15.211 every time you run the command.For overcoming the above
problem we connect both the machines using ssh keys.

* Generation of ssh keys
 We can have the computer generate two key files – one public that belongs on the remote server,
and one private which is on your computer and needs to be secure – and these
will be used instead of a password.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ssh -keygen -t rsa 
#+END_EXAMPLE
This will generate two keys(public and private key) and place them in the following directory 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
~/.ssh
#+END_EXAMPLE
with the names id_rsa for your private key and id_rsa.pub for your public key.
Just hit enter to leave it as blank when asked for.

We will be generating ssh keys in both the machines and sharing them connect
the machines.

Connection can be established by the following command.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub vlead@10.4.15.211:~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
#+END_EXAMPLE
After running the command you will be asked to enter the password of
vlead@10.4.15.211.After entering the password the connection will be estblished
between the hostmachine and container.

* Copying files using shell script
If we want to run more number of commands at a time we use shell script which
automatically runs the commands in it.For copying we are using the following
shell script.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
rsync -avz root@10.4.15.211:~/virat/sample.txt 
#+END_EXAMPLE
The above command copies sample.txt which is in virat directory from
hostmachine to root@10.4.15.211.

for running shell script file first copy the above command in sample.sh.
We can run sample.sh using
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
chmod a+x sample.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
./sample.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE
